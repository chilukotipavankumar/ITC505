    <h2>Addendum:</h2>
<p>I've made some improvements to Lab 2 by using CSS to give it a more professional and polished look.</p> 
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Font and Text Styling</h3>
            <p>For the body, Arial, a sans-serif typeface, is chosen for its clean design and ease of readability. Known for its professional appearance, Arial is a widely used and well-crafted font. The line height is set to 1.6, providing ample space between lines to enhance readability. A margin of 20px is applied around the text to prevent it from running too close to the screen edges, offering a comfortable reading experience. The background color is a light shade (#f9f9f9) paired with dark gray text (#333333) to reduce eye strain and improve readability.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3>Centering Header Information</h3>
            <p>The .center-content class centers the text to ensure that header information, such as the name and contact details, stands out. A bottom margin of 20px ensures there is adequate space between the header and the following content, maintaining a neat layout.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3>Main Title Styling</h3>
            <p>The h1 element is centered to make the main title (name) prominent and easily noticeable. The font size is set to 32px and bolded to emphasize its importance. A slightly darker gray color (#1a1a1a) is used for the title to enhance its prominence.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3>Section Titles</h3>
            <p>For h2 elements, text alignment is set to left to maintain the natural flow of reading and distinguish section titles from the main title. The font size is 24px to clearly denote major sections. A top margin of 30px and a bottom margin of 15px create sufficient space around the headings, ensuring they are distinct from the content. The color remains consistent with the main title color (#1a1a1a).</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3>Article Sections</h3>
            <p>Each article section has a 40px bottom margin to ensure clear separation, making the document easier to read and visually appealing. The background color is white (#ffffff) to provide clarity and contrast against the light background. Articles have a padding of 15px for internal spacing and rounded corners (8px) for a modern look. A subtle shadow (0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)) adds depth to the articles.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3>Unordered Lists and List Items</h3>
            <p>For ul elements, a padding-left of 40px is applied to indent list items, making them distinct from the surrounding text and improving readability. A margin-bottom of 20px separates lists from subsequent content. li elements have a margin-bottom of 10px to ensure space between items, enhancing readability.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3>Footer Styling</h3>
            <p>The footer is centered to make it visually distinct from the main content and easily noticeable. A top margin of 40px ensures sufficient space between the footer and the content above it. The font size is smaller (14px) with a lighter gray color (#666666) for less prominent text. The background color is white (#ffffff) to ensure clarity and contrast against the light background. The footer has 10px padding for internal spacing, a light top border (#e0e0e0), and a subtle shadow (0 -2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)) to add separation and depth. The border radius (0 0 8px 8px) ensures a cohesive look with the article sections.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3>Paragraphs and Emphasis</h3>
            <p>Paragraphs (p) have a 20px margin-bottom to ensure space below them, maintaining clear separation between blocks of text. Bold text (strong) uses black (#000000) to ensure it stands out for emphasis.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <h3>HTML Abuse Corrections</h3>
            <p>Regarding HTML abuse corrections, the title, initially marked with an h2 for stylistic reasons, is corrected to h1 to reflect its role as the highest-level heading. Section titles, previously marked with h3 or h4 tags for size reasons, are updated to h2 to reflect their importance as major sections. Deprecated tags like <code>&lt;center&gt;</code> have been replaced with appropriate CSS styling to adhere to modern HTML standards.</p>
